Invasion - By Simon Price - 1 May 2000

What's this ?

It's a little demo of how to make really cool, fast graphics, with so few lines of code that I wrote it in just one day! Explosions, stars, UFOs and bullets are thrown around the screen at amazing pace by using a few API functions. They are BitBlt, StretchBlt, SetPixel, MoveToEx and LineTo. 

How does it work ?

Well, I ain't explaining no boring trigonometry to explain how the bullets go in the right direction etc. but the main lesson here is the graphics. I use something called a backbuffer. I'm not a DirectX fan (I haven't even got DX7) and I am stubborn and still believe that the good old API serve me well enough. So I draw everything onto a picturebox, then I use StretchBlt to copy it to screen. This method is fast and does not leave any horrible flickering.

Want more games ?

This game took me just 1 day. If you want to see much better games that I've made, and download the source code for free, visit my website :

My website only has games programming materials on it: downloads, tutorials etc. I specialise in making games in VB (OK, it's the only thing I know, I mean, I've had a PC for less than 6 months)
