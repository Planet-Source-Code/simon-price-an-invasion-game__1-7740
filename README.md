## An Invasion Game


</div>

### Description

Invasion is an excellent example of how to make really cool, explosive, fast graphics in your games. UFO's fly down the screen and your job is to stop them from getting to the bottom. Luckily, I've armed you with a big machine gun which fires at 20 rounds pers second! This screenshot cannot begin to describe to total mayhem of bullets and explosions - this game is very fast... If you enjoy of learn from this, a vote it return is not too much to ask!
